# More code...
More examples of code I've made:
- **seasonality.py**: Python function that calculates the seasonality index for touristic destinations from the data given by the monthly ocupation in a given year.
- **scrap_bcn_streets.py**: Python script that scraps the meaning and more info of the streets of Barcelona and saves the data in a JSON file. This data is necessary for an Android app I'm designing.
